# tic-tac-toe-v3

This is an initial commit for a Team Treehouse Project. 
This fun TicTacToe game is coded for both human and computer play. 

# Some future improvements:
-Refactor Code for more elegant solution
-Add nicer UX Messages
-Add a more intelligent computer that doesn't choose arbitrary squares, but rather mimics human behavior.
